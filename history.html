                            <div class="rail">In its heyday of 1906, the railway branched off in four directions from Dundalk Station. One line headed east to Carlingford and Omeath, another west to counties Monaghan, Fermanagh, Tyrone, Donegal and Derry, and finally -- the surviving north and south lines to Belfast and Dublin respectively. 
                                In the picture below we count approximately an additional 20 stations which are now, regrettably, closed down and all the adjoining track lifted.

It was located in the foothills of the Cooley Mountains, above the village of Omeath, and was also bordered very closely by a similar Gaeltacht region in South Armagh. A documentary was made on the subject, which is available to listen to (here), as well as this, recording were made of native speakers recounting local folklore as well as basic conversation and grammar in the language - the numbers, days of the week. etc. They can be found here (doegen.ie)</p></div>
