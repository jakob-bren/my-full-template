One line headed east to Carlingford and Omeath, another west to counties Monaghan, Fermanagh, Tyrone, Donegal and Derry, and finally -- the surviving north and south lines to Belfast and Dublin respectively. 
                                In the picture below we count approximately an additional 20 stations which are now, regrettably, closed down and all the adjoining track lifted.

                            <div class="town"><p>Until 2013, Dundalk was the site of what was once the oldest shopping centre in Ireland - the aptly 
                                named Old Dundalk Shopping Centre. This archaeological site was home to a butchers, an ATM, a bench, a childs play vehicle and
                                two Tesco's, as well as numerous other vacant rooms known locally as "closed-down stores". Not much is known about the function
                                of these empty rooms - some historians speculate they contained sacrificial altars, or possibly record stores and restaurants.

                                Little photographic record remains of this fascinating historical site - indeed half the pictures are just reconstructions of 
                                what it could have once looked like - such as this set of AI-generated images posted on Twitter.

                            of England. At this treaty meeting, a truce was decided and, among other things, County Louth changed hands from Ulster to Leinster.

                            In 1921 a jailbreak was made from Dundalk Gaol by anti-treaty IRA men. 
                            Some months later these anti-treaty IRA volunteers, led by Frank Aiken, would return to Dundalk 
                            and conduct a night-time raid on what is now known as Aiken Barracks.</p>

                        <div class="fun"><p>Up until the late 1960s, County Louth had a Gaeltacht region - one of the very last remnants of the East Ulster dialect. 
                            It was located in the foothills of the Cooley Mountains, above the village of Omeath, and was also bordered very closely by a similar 
                            Gaeltacht region in South Armagh. A documentary was made on the subject, which is available to listen to (here), 
                            as well as this, recordings were made of native speakers recounting local folklore as well as basic conversation
                             and grammar in the language - the numbers, days of the week. etc. They can be found here: <a href="https://doegen.ie/taxonomy/term/21984">www.doegen.ie/taxonomy/term/21984</a></a></p>

                             <p> As attested to in <a href="http://cluaindaimh.blogspot.com/2009/08/leid-beag-1.html">this blog</a> pertaining to the Gaeilge spoken in Cluain Daimh/Clonduff, County Down,
                            one of the peculiar features of the Gaelic spoken in County Louth was that it concorded with the Gaelic spoken in Scotland in that in place of "ni", "cha" was used as the negative particle - 
                            i.e "cha raibh" (or indeed cha rabh) instead of "ni raibh" </p>
