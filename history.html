            <p class="indent">Dundalk Town as so-named was founded in the 12th century by the Normans, however the area has been inhabited 
            since at least 3700BC, with many of the present-day townlands predating the Norman conquest.</p>
            <p class="indent">Indeed Proleek Dolmen slightly outside Dundalk Town dates back as far as the Neolithic Period in 3000BC, the three stones
                 reportedly having been carried all the way to its present location by a Scottish giant. Whatever the truth of this assertion
                it is plain to see that North Louth is an area steeped in a rich history.</p>

                    In its heyday of 1906, the railway branched off in four directions from Dundalk Station. One line headed east to Carlingford and Omeath, another west to counties Monaghan, Fermanagh, Tyrone, Donegal and Derry, and finally -- the surviving north and south lines to Belfast and Dublin respectively. 
                    In the picture below we count approximately an additional 20 stations which are now, regrettably, closed down and all the adjoining track lifted.

                    Some local folks have put together an enchanting video, featuring a song written in 1952 commemorating the Dundalk-Greenore-Newry railway line, packed full of
                    valuable historical photographs.

                    The Dundalk-Greenore-Newry Railway first opened in 1873 between Dundalk and Greenore, with the section to Newry opening in 1876.
                    Three mixed-use freight/passenger trains ran each and every day up until the 31st of December 1951, whereafter the passenger service was 
                    replaced by buses. 
                    The lyrics of the song heard in the video above can be seen in full in the below image.

                    Besides all of the above, Dundalk also once played host to a railway works - which once built trains for the GNR line and finished up in the mid-1980s
                    making bogies for the Bord na MÃ³na Turf Train.

                    The line between Dundalk Clarke and Dundalk Quay St/Barrack St, although in disuse for many decades, was not ripped up until the mid-1990s. Some of the railway buildings
                    still stand in one form or another, including the HSE primary care centre on Barrack St. which used to be a railway shed.

                    The modern street layout of Dundalk owes its provenance to 
                    James Hamilton, Earl of Clanbrassil, who was an agent of James VI and a Scottish settler.
                    He gained ownership of Dundalk following the Williamite War of 1690 after its former owner had fallen
                    into huge debts. Owing to the war and Dundalk's general status as a frontier town, it was a 
                    place marked both by heavy military fortifications and by the scars of said war which
                    had left the town walls in ruins. Hamilton, drawing inspiration from his visits to continental Europe,
                    commissioned the construction of streets radiating out from the town centre while also
                    demolishing completely the ruined walls and the 15th century castles.

                    Until 2013, Dundalk was the site of what was once the oldest shopping centre in Ireland - the aptly 
                    named Old Dundalk Shopping Centre. This archaeological site was home to a butchers, an ATM, a bench, a childs play vehicle and
                    two Tesco's, as well as numerous other vacant rooms known locally as "closed-down stores". Not much is known about the function
                    of these empty rooms - some historians speculate they contained sacrificial altars, or possibly record stores and restaurants.
                    <br><br>
                    Little photographic record remains of this fascinating historical site - indeed half the pictures are just reconstructions of 
                    what it could have once looked like - such as a recently-published set of AI-generated images, which can be found on Twitter.

                    In 1596 Dundalk (or more precisely Faughart) was the site of a meeting between Hugh O'Neill on behalf of Ulster and Thomas Butler, 
                    10th Earl of Ormond on behalf of England. At this meeting, the latter party offered O'Neill and the Ulster chieftains possession of
                    all of Ulster save for County Louth, Carrickfergus and Newry - which were all held by English garrisons. It is reputed that this offer was
                    rejected, but nonetheless it formed the basis for County Louth being considered by some as part of Leinster rather than Ulster. </p>

                    In 1921 a jailbreak was made from Dundalk Gaol by anti-treaty IRA men. 
                    Some months later these anti-treaty IRA volunteers, led by Frank Aiken, would return to Dundalk 
                    and conduct a night-time raid on what is now known as Aiken Barracks.

                            Up until the late 1960s, County Louth had a Gaeltacht region - one of the very last remnants of the East Ulster dialect. 
                            It was located in the foothills of the Cooley Mountains, above the village of Omeath, and was also bordered very closely by a similar 
                            Gaeltacht region in South Armagh. A documentary was made on the subject, which is available to listen to (here), 
                            as well as this, recordings were made of native speakers recounting local folklore as well as basic conversation
                            and grammar in the language - the numbers, days of the week. etc. They can be found here: <a href="https://doegen.ie/taxonomy/term/21984">www.doegen.ie/taxonomy/term/21984</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>By way of example, we have pulled from the website an example of a woman named Brighid NÃ­ Chaslaigh recounting numerals between
                            one and twenty. One other striking feature of the local dialect is that both "ceathair" (four) and "fiche" (twenty) were 
                            pronounced with only one syllable, to sound like "care" and "fee" respectively rather than "cat-her" or "fee-hah".

                            As attested to in <a href="http://cluaindaimh.blogspot.com/2009/08/leid-beag-1.html">this blog</a> 
                            pertaining to the Gaeilge spoken in Cluain Daimh/Clonduff, County Down (which bore great similarity to the Gaeilge in Louth), another of the notable features of 
                            the Gaelic spoken in County Louth was that it concorded with the Gaelic spoken in Scotland in
                            using "cha" in place of "ni" as the negative particle - i.e "cha raibh" (or indeed cha rabh) 
                            instead of "ni raibh". The map contained in this section shows the approximate divide where "cha" becomes "ni" and 
                            vice-versa in the speech of everyday folks.
                        </p>

                        <p>Sources differ on when exactly the last speaker - Anna O'Hanlon - died, ranging from 1957 to 1969, but what is
                            without doubt is that it is a great tragedy not only that the native dialect of County Louth/the wider Oriel area
                            is dead, but that so few knew just how long it managed to survive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The resources - books, songs and recorded speech - available to us are a great treasure which deserve wider attention.
                            We consider it very important that the identity of the speech in County Louth with that of Monaghan, Armagh, Down, Antrim etc
                            is stressed, in order that the "border" in peoples minds is chipped away at just that little bit more.
