            <p class="indent">Dundalk Town as so-named was founded in the 12th century by the Normans, however the area has been inhabited 
            since at least 3700BC, with many of the present-day townlands predating the Norman conquest.</p>
            <p class="indent">Indeed Proleek Dolmen slightly outside Dundalk Town dates back as far as the Neolithic Period in 3000BC, the three stones
                 reportedly having been carried all the way to its present location by a Scottish giant. Whatever the truth of this assertion
                it is plain to see that North Louth is an area steeped in a rich history.</p>

                                In its heyday of 1906, the railway branched off in four directions from Dundalk Station. One line headed east to Carlingford and Omeath, another west to counties Monaghan, Fermanagh, Tyrone, Donegal and Derry, and finally -- the surviving north and south lines to Belfast and Dublin respectively. 
                                In the picture below we count approximately an additional 20 stations which are now, regrettably, closed down and all the adjoining track lifted.

                                Some local folks have put together an enchanting video, featuring a song written in 1952 commemorating the Dundalk-Greenore-Newry railway line, packed full of
                                valuable historical photographs.

                                The Dundalk-Greenore-Newry Railway first opened in 1873 between Dundalk and Greenore, with the section to Newry opening in 1876.
                                Three mixed-use freight/passenger trains ran each and every day up until the 31st of December 1951, whereafter the passenger service was 
                                replaced by buses. 
                                The lyrics of the song heard in the video above can be seen in full in the below image.

                                Besides all of the above, Dundalk also once played host to a railway works - which once built trains for the GNR line and finished up in the mid-1980s
                                making bogies for the Bord na Móna Turf Train.

                                The line between Dundalk Clarke and Dundalk Quay St/Barrack St, although in disuse for many decades, was not ripped up until the mid-1990s. Some of the railway buildings
                                still stand in one form or another, including the HSE primary care centre on Barrack St. which used to be a railway shed.

                                Until 2013, Dundalk was the site of what was once the oldest shopping centre in Ireland - the aptly 
                                named Old Dundalk Shopping Centre. This archaeological site was home to a butchers, an ATM, a bench, a childs play vehicle and
                                two Tesco's, as well as numerous other vacant rooms known locally as "closed-down stores". Not much is known about the function
                                of these empty rooms - some historians speculate they contained sacrificial altars, or possibly record stores and restaurants.

                                Little photographic record remains of this fascinating historical site - indeed half the pictures are just reconstructions of 
                                what it could have once looked like - such as this set of AI-generated images posted on Twitter.

                                In 1603 Dundalk was the site of a treaty between Hugh O'Neill on behalf of Ulster and X Z on behalf
                                of England. At this treaty meeting, a truce was decided and, among other things, County Louth changed hands from 
                                Ulster to Leinster.</p>

                                In 1921 a jailbreak was made from Dundalk Gaol by anti-treaty IRA men. 
                                Some months later these anti-treaty IRA volunteers, led by Frank Aiken, would return to Dundalk 
                                and conduct a night-time raid on what is now known as Aiken Barracks.

                                        Up until the late 1960s, County Louth had a Gaeltacht region - one of the very last remnants of the East Ulster dialect. 
                                        It was located in the foothills of the Cooley Mountains, above the village of Omeath, and was also bordered very closely by a similar 
                                        Gaeltacht region in South Armagh. A documentary was made on the subject, which is available to listen to (here), 
                                        as well as this, recordings were made of native speakers recounting local folklore as well as basic conversation
                                        and grammar in the language - the numbers, days of the week. etc. They can be found here: <a href="https://doegen.ie/taxonomy/term/21984">www.doegen.ie/taxonomy/term/21984</a>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>By way of example, we have pulled from the website an example of a woman named Brighid Ní Chaslaigh recounting numerals between
                                        one and twenty. One other striking feature of the local dialect is that both "ceathair" (four) and "fiche" (twenty) were 
                                        pronounced with only one syllable, to sound like "care" and "fee" respectively rather than "cat-her" or "fee-hah".

                                        As attested to in <a href="http://cluaindaimh.blogspot.com/2009/08/leid-beag-1.html">this blog</a> 
                                        pertaining to the Gaeilge spoken in Cluain Daimh/Clonduff, County Down (which bore great similarity to the Gaeilge in Louth), another of the notable features of 
                                        the Gaelic spoken in County Louth was that it concorded with the Gaelic spoken in Scotland in
                                        using "cha" in place of "ni" as the negative particle - i.e "cha raibh" (or indeed cha rabh) 
                                        instead of "ni raibh". The map contained in this section shows the approximate divide where "cha" becomes "ni" and 
                                        vice-versa in the speech of everyday folks.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Sources differ on when exactly the last speaker - Anna O'Hanlon - died, ranging from 1957 to 1969, but what is
                                        without doubt is that it is a great tragedy not only that the native dialect of County Louth/the wider Oriel area
                                        is dead, but that so few knew just how long it managed to survive.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The resources - books, songs and recorded speech - available to us are a great treasure which deserve wider attention.
                                        We consider it very important that the identity of the speech in County Louth with that of Monaghan, Armagh, Down, Antrim etc
                                        is stressed, in order that the "border" in peoples minds is chipped away at just that little bit more.
